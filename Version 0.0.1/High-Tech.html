This book outlines much of the tech that will be in some way present during the campaign. While looking through the book you may come across "TL" and a number next to some equipment. TL in this case stands for "Time Line" though functionally it can also mean "Tech Level" as they are about the same. We will be using items from TL5 up to TL7 with only some exceptions. Depending on how many years pass during the course of play TL8 stuff may slowly be released into the world.<br class="wikidpad" />

In addition, the campaign takes place starting in 1969, Washington state. No item should be accessible to the players that was produced after 1969 unless there is a version that has been in production before that year. Default to using the older version.<br class="wikidpad" />

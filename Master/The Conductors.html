The Conductors run a new form of the Underground Rail Road. People offer food, water, and shelter to those trying to make their way north into Canada where it is easier to immigrate to where they would like to be. The primary group they assist are those escaping work camps as they are actively hunted and it is much harder to cross the board for them.    </body>

The Resistance refers to the group of diverse people fighting explicitly the United States government in a bout to gain rights for minority groups including but not limited to black people, homosexuals, and women. They also seek a less corrupt democracy with less violence against political opposition parties including the violence again Communists.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Resistance was founded unofficially in 1956 by the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Leader.html" class="wikidpad">Leader</a></span>. They, along with a close friend named <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Richard%20Donald.html" class="wikidpad">Richard Donald</a></span>, gathered five other members to begin their planing. The goal? Root out fascism. The means? Protests and riots at first. Political violence second. They developed an underground network for moving information and organizing people for the cause. Nearly every protest and riot from the West coast to the East had, in some way, can be linked back to the Resistance.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Resistance is funded mostly through anonymous sponsors and donations from members. This usually leaves things spread rather thin, though most members are accustomed to working with very little. One source of resources comes from the [USSR]. They saw this as an opportunity to spread their form of communism within American territory without drawing too much attention. They donate food, water, weapons, money, and other miscellaneous gear that may come in handy. The equipment is hidden around the country in abandoned buildings, in peoples attics, and where ever else people could think to hid it. Some crates are even buried under farmland waiting for the right moment.<br class="wikidpad" />

In 1957, Leader put [Robert Irwine] in charge of communications and espionage.

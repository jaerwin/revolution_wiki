Welcome to the shared Wiki for gameplay. This will be used to keep track of the rules and setting of the game. I've tried to make this as easy to navigate as I can. If you have ever used a Wiki then you shouldn't have an issue figuring it out. If you find any mistakes, please take note of where and let me know. I will fix it and send out an updated file when available. If you have any requests on what to add to the Wiki please let me know.<br class="wikidpad" />

There are a lot of books available in GURPS, however we will only use a select few. We are focusing only on 4e. If there is something you think we should consider from 3e then let the DM know. We should refrain from going any further back in editions to avoid complications. The books in use are as follows:<br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad bulletlist">
<li class="wikidpad" />Basic Set - Characters
<li class="wikidpad" />Basic Set - Campaigns
<li class="wikidpad" /><span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="High-Tech.html" class="wikidpad">High-Tech</a></span>
<li class="wikidpad" />High-Tech - Pulp Guns Vol. 1
<li class="wikidpad" />High-Tech - Pulp Guns Vol. 2
<li class="wikidpad" /><span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="High-Tech%20-%20Weapons%20Table.html" class="wikidpad">High-Tech - Weapons Table</a></span>
<li class="wikidpad" /><span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Seals%20in%20Vietnam.html" class="wikidpad">Seals in Vietnam</a></span>
<li class="wikidpad" />[Tactical Shooting]<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
There are other books that contain skill, items, perks, etc. that may be of interest. These books have not been largely taken into consideration, so be warned some abilities may be wasteful. However there are things that are realistic for the setting so would not be out of the question as far as knowledge is concerned. These books are as follows:<br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad bulletlist">
<li class="wikidpad" />Martial Arts
<li class="wikidpad" />Low-Tech and Companions<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
GURPS also has a series known as Pyramid and some content from it can be considered during the campaign and character creation. Pyramid #3 is all we will focus on and like the books have a few notable issues that I will allow specifically.<br class="wikidpad" />
Those issues are:<br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad bulletlist">
<li class="wikidpad" />Pyramid #3-33 - Low-Tech<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
<a name=".h1813" class="wikidpad"></a><h1 class="wikidpad heading-level1"><b class="wikidpad">Setting:</b></h1>
January 10th, 1969. President George Wallace gives his State of the Union Address. He congratulates the country on its ability to stamp out Communism. He celebrates the largest American work camp built in California. Meanwhile, many minorities are round up and either deported if possible, imprisoned if needed, or sent straight to works camps that now dot the landscape. Fascism  has effectively won over the American people and its politicians. There is hope though.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Over the years post WWII people started seeing the writing on the walls. Literally, fascist propaganda covered walls, played in theaters, and was blasted over the air waves. Those who feared for their lives started taking to the streets in protests and riots. When it was clear that wouldn't be enough many groups started stockpiling food, water, and weapons.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="The%20Resistance.html" class="wikidpad">The Resistance</a></span> generally refers to anyone apart of the fight against the government. There are sub groups within, but some just refer to themselves as being apart of The Resistance. Gun running, moonshining, espionage. These are but some of the jobs done by underground resistance members. All orders come from anonymous leaders who base their operations out of Seattle Washington. The highest leader and starter of the modern movement is simply referred to as <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Leader.html" class="wikidpad">Leader</a></span> or L for short.<br class="wikidpad" />

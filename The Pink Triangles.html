The Pink Triangles were formed by homosexual people who escaped Nazi Germany during the fighting. The Nazis branded them with a pink triangle patch when sending them to camps, and thus the group has reappropriated it into a symbol of pride. With the US have strict anti-gay laws, they now find themselves facing the same persicution as where they escaped from. Many opened inns where other gays, lesbians, etc could shelter themselves.<br class="wikidpad" />

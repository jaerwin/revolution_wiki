Born in Charleston, West Virginia, Richard stood out by being more of a scholar than a jock. He spent most of his time absorbing any knowledge he could get his hands on. His GPA remained 4.0 all through high school and won several local debate matches through the schools debate club. He met <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Leader.html" class="wikidpad">Leader</a></span> during his travel to a debate being held in Lansing, Michigan. The bus stopped mid way in a small town and his first response was to hit the books at the local library while he waited. There he saw Leader, reading by themselves in a corner, hoarding a sizable pile of books. He sat with here, taking a book from the pile, and began reading. From there they started talking a bit and became fast friends based on their shared interest in academia.<br class="wikidpad" />
